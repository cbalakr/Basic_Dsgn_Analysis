2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_rx_i0_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_rx_i0/rst_dst_reg/PRE, rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_rx_i0/rst_meta_reg/PRE, rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_samp_i0/rst_dst_reg/PRE, rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_samp_i0/rst_meta_reg/PRE, rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_tx_i0/rst_dst_reg/PRE, rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_tx_i0/rst_meta_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 3.333 -name clk_pin_p -waveform {0.000 1.666} [get_ports clk_pin_p] (Source: c:/training/Basic_Dsgn_Analysis/lab/KCU105/verilog/wave_gen.srcs/constrs_1/imports/verilog/wave_gen_timing.xdc (Line: 2))

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 3.333 -name clk_pin_p -waveform {0.000 1.666} [get_ports clk_pin_p] (Source: c:/training/Basic_Dsgn_Analysis/lab/KCU105/verilog/wave_gen.srcs/constrs_1/imports/verilog/wave_gen_timing.xdc (Line: 2))

CLKC-9#1 Advisory
BUFGCE with active CE has BUFG driver  
The BUFGCE cell clk_gen_i0/BUFGCE_clk_samp_i0 clk_gen_i0/BUFGCE_clk_samp_i0/I pin (and CE is ACTIVE) is driven by BUFGCE clock buffer clk_gen_i0/clk_core_i0/inst/clkout2_buf. It should be reconnected in parallel to the driving clock buffer in order to reduce skew. Cascaded buffers introduce skew that can lead to difficult or impossible timing closure.
